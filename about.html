        <h1>TikZ Graph Gen</h1>
        <h2>By Andrew Salls</h2>
        <p class="pg">This website is a tool for generating graphs based on the LaTeX TikZ library. <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/" hreflang="en-US">LaTeX</a> is a typesetting system primarily used for enabling easy use of symbols, diagrams, and macros, and more in documents. It is ubiquitous in the world of professional academic and scientific writing.</p>
        <p class="pg"><a href="https://github.com/pgf-tikz/pgf">TikZ</a> is a package for use within LaTeX. It is a powerful graphics library for creating all types of figures, with several other libraries that extend it for more niche visuals. More specifically, TikZ is a set of macros within the larget PGF library designed to make it easier to use without needing to understand the entire (as of writing) <a href="https://pgf-tikz.github.io/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf">1,322 page manual</a>.</p>
        <p class="pg">For most people using TikZ, it is too powerful for their purposes, making it hard to use. This website focuses specifically on graphs (the mathematical object from graph theory, not the tool for visualizing data), and aims to make it easier to create simple graphs within TikZ. Ideally, this makes it easier to tweak graphs as necessary.</p>

        <p class="pg indentless">Of course, you can use the site without knowing about or caring about LaTeX. Who am I to stop you?</p>
        <p>P.S. You can use any images or graphs created using this tool without attribution (CC0), although I would appreciate it if you choose to credit me and/or the tool anyways :)</p>
